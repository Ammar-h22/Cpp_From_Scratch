// C++ --> Initially called --> C with classes by stroustroup.
// class --> extension of structures (in C).

// structures had limitations:
//           ---> members are public
//           ---> No methods

// classes --> structures + more
// classes --> can have methods and properties  
// classes --> can make few members as private and few as public. 

// You can declare objects along with the class declaration like this:
        /* class Employee{
            // class definition
        } harry, rohan, manas; */

// harry.salary = 7 --> makes no sense if salary is private
