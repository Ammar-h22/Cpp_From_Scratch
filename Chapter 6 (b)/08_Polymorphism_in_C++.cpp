/* 
Polymorphism :
--> Ek naam aur multiple kaam / one name and multiple forms
--> Eg: Function overloading , operator overloading , constructor overloading.
--> Eg: Virtual Functions 

Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:
1. (Compile time Polymorphism)
   This Compile time Polymophism is also called as early binding.
   Compile time Polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
   1.1 - Function overloading
   1.2 - Operator overloading

2. (Run time Polymorphism)
   This Run time Polymorphism is also called as late binding.
   Run time Polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
   2.1 - Virtual functions
